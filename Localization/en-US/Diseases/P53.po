msgid "P53"
msgstr ""

msgid "Over half of all known cancers involve some mutation in p53, the so-called guardian of the cell. p53 is a tumor-suppressor which signals for cell death if DNA gets damaged."
msgstr ""

msgid "Without p53, damaged DNA can lead to the unusual growths found in cancer tumors. When p53 breaks down and does not fold correctly, then DNA damage goes unchecked and mutations can proliferate. We have been studying specific domains of p53 in order to predict mutations relevant in cancer and to study known cancer-related mutants."
