msgid "Here are our peer-reviewed results from Folding@home. For summaries of these methods and papers, as well as the scientific background behind Folding@home, please see the [Folding@home article on Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Folding@home)."

msgid "For all of the papers from the Pande Lab (not just those from Folding@home), please see our [group papers page](http://pande.stanford.edu/papers). Note that it can take quite a while to go from a result to a published peer review article (often as much as a year). These papers represent our progress to date that’s publicly available, with lots more on the way."

msgid "The distribution rules for published papers vary by the publication in which the paper appears. Due to these rules, a public web-source of each paper may not be immediately available. If full version is not linked below or available elsewhere on the Internet ([Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/) can be helpful for this), most, if not all of these publications are freely available at a local municipal or collegial library. Note these articles are written for fellow scientists, so the contents are fairly technical."
