msgid "The distribution rules for published papers vary by the publication in which the paper appears. Due to these rules, a public web-source of each paper may not be immediately available. If full version is not linked below or available elsewhere on the Internet ([Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/) can be helpful for this), most, if not all of these publications are freely available at a local municipal or collegial library. Note these articles are written for fellow scientists, so the contents are fairly technical."
