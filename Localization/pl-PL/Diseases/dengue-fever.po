Only 9 countries had experienced severe Dengue epidemics prior to 1970, but now the disease is prevalent in over 100 countries. There are no existing approved treatments for Dengue once infection occurs.  We are using a combination of cheminformatics and machine learning, in close coordination with experimental colleagues, to develop new therapies for Dengue."
